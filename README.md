# HCJ_2nd_Project
i have made a beautiful and simple nav bar in which i upload my picture as a logo
and then the main page shows my career name 
basically its a general website so you can edit as you want to do so its not about me either
then on second page there is headings + images means whenever you hover on that headings you will see the image on that particular div, its look amazing 
and then a about page and at last there is a footer

There is a smooth scroll in website as well
